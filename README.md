# Westeros-Interactive-Map
Game Of Thrones.

**Hints:**

1. To add new house -> Mouse Right-Click on the Map.
2. To Move the Map after "Zoom" -> Mouse Left-Click + Drag.
3. To use the enclosed Database (WesterosDB), load it to `Xampp` server on the local host (by default), otherwise if chose different server -> change the connection configuration in the `Main` Class.
4. Requires `mysql-connector-java-5.1.20-bin.jar` to be added to the classpath (*included*)
