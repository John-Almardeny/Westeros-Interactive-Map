# Westeros-Interactive-Map
Game Of Thrones.

Some hints:

1. To add new house -> Right Mouse Click on the Map.
2. To Move the Map after "Zoom" -> Mouse Left-Click Mouse + Drag.
3. To use the enclosed Database (WesterosDB), load it to Xampp server on the local host (by default), otherwise if chose different server -> check the connection establishment in the "Main" Class.
